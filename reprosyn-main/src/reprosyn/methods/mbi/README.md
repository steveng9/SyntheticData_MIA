# Marginal-Based Inference

This method implements the MST algorithm that was the winning solution in the 2018 NIST differential privacy synthetic data competitions.

We adapt [mst.py](https://github.com/ryan112358/private-pgm/blob/master/mechanisms/mst.py) for the census teaching file ([MST paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04978)). 

See the repository [private-pgm](https://github.com/ryan112358/private-pgm) for details on the `mbi` package, and the accompanying theoretical [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09136).
