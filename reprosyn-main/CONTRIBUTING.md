# Contributing to Reprosyn

We welcome contributions of any kind. Thank you!

Here is a non-exhaustive list of how to contribute.

## User testing

If you come across a bug during using the package, or if there are alterations to improve the use, please raise an issue with a clear description of the problem or desired feature.

## Add features

Reprosyn is a fairly immature project and there are many improvements to make. If you are thinking about a new feature it would be worth discussing the feature in a github issue before making a pull request.

If you have a method that it would be useful to have in Reprosyn, see our documentation for [Adding Methods](), and make a pull-request!
